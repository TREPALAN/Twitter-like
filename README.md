Network a single app application inspired by twitter/x built with Django combined with Htmx and Javascript to make the site more responsive and user-friendly.
## Functionalities
* create and customize a profile
* write a post
* edit or delete a post
* like a post
* follow and unfollow user
* see user profile
* see users posts
* see who the user is following and who he is being followed by
* see all from all users
* see posts made just for people who you follow
* reply and see all the replies of one post

### Pagination
as you may probably know the Twitter feed doesn't load all posts at once so neither does this project.
* the posts and users are loaded with pagination once you get to the bottom of the page with the help of htmx combined with  Django pagination
